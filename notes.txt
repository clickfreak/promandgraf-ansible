cAdvisor running with --docker_only=true and --disable_root_cgroup_stats=true
cAdvisor collect too much metrics about fs objects

Ensure dockerd is running and can run dummy container:
- install (networks collision)
- upgrade docker.io
- loki driver install
- loki driver upgrade

Loki driver:
- check for loki driver installed and usage
  curl -s --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock http:/plugins
  log generator: https://hub.docker.com/r/chentex/random-logger/

if we previously defined the container command, and then removed it, then the ansible docker module will not consider this as a change in the container

TODO:
 - add healthchecks for containers
 - add wait_for for prometheus container to ensure it do scraping metrics
 - use healthcheck feature on container (https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/community/docker/docker_container_module.html#parameter-healthcheck)
